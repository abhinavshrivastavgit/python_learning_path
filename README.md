# 🚀 Python General Project Lab: AI Product Management Edition

Welcome to my technical lab. As an aspiring **AI Product Manager**, I believe that understanding the "how" behind the code is just as important as the "why" behind the product. This repository tracks my evolution from basic syntax to building the logic engines that power AI-driven products.

## 🛠️ Portfolio Labs & File Guide

### 📊 Ranking & Data Comparison
**Goal:** Implement logic to rank product features or numerical outputs dynamically.
- **Key Concepts:** Sorting logic, indexing, and list manipulation.
- **Files:** `ranking_number.py` & `ranking_number.txt`

### 📦 Inventory Lifecycle Manager
**Goal:** Transition from single variables to managing collections of hardware (GPUs).
- **Key Concepts:** `list`, `.append()`, `.remove()`, and `len()`.
- **Logic:** Implemented a system to add/remove chips from the product stack to simulate inventory management.
- **File:** `inventory_manager.py`

### 🤖 Logic & Comparison Engines
**Goal:** Automating decision-making processes through code.
- **Grading Logic Engine:** Automated performance tiering using threshold-based logic gates.
- **Largest Number:** Identifies peak values within a dataset to assist in prioritizing product metrics.
- **Files:** `random_grading.py`, `random_grading.txt`, `largest_number.py`, & `largest_number.txt`

### 🏥 System Health Monitoring
**Goal:** Proactive hardware maintenance simulation.
- **Logic:** Threshold-based monitoring of system vitals (CPU/RAM) for AI-integrated robotics.
- **Files:** `robot_health.py` & `robot_health.txt`

### 👁️ Computer Vision Data Structuring
**Goal:** Build "Engineering Intuition" for how AI models store metadata.
- **Confidence Builder:** Demonstrates the use of **Tuples** (for fixed resolution), **Sets** (for unique detection values), and **Dictionaries** (for complex object labeling).
- **Files:** `confidence_builder01.py` & `confidence_builder01.txt`

### 📝 Project Documentation & Skills
- **README.md:** Professional portfolio overview and project guide.
- **Exercise Summary:** Ongoing documentation of technical logic flow and future roadmap updates.
