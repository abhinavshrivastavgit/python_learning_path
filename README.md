# 🚀 Python for AI Product Management: My Coding Journey

Welcome to my technical lab. As an aspiring AI PM, I believe that understanding the "how" behind the code is just as important as the "why" behind the product. This repository tracks my daily progress from zero to building logic engines for the AI industry.

## 📈 The Progress Tracker
| Day | Focus Area | Key Achievement |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **01** | Setup & Env | Configured VS Code, Python 3.12, and Virtual Environments. |
| **02** | Variables | Calculated chip margins and understood float/int logic. |
| **03** | Inputs | Built a user-interactive terminal for dynamic data. |
| **04** | Logic | Created the **Hiring Bot** using multi-layer conditional logic. |
| **05** | Lists | Built an **Inventory Manager** to handle product portfolios. |
| **06** | Dictionaries | *Coming Soon...* |

## 🛠️ Featured Daily Labs

### 📦 Day 05: Inventory Lifecycle Manager
**Goal:** Transition from single variables to managing collections of hardware (GPUs).
- **Key Concepts:** `list`, `.append()`, `.remove()`, and `len()`.
- **Logic:** Implemented a system to add new chips and "discontinue" old models from the stack.
- **File:** `inventory_manager.py`

### 🤖 Day 04: The Hiring Bot
**Goal:** Automate technical screening logic.
- **Key Concepts:** `.lower()`, `.strip()`, and `if-elif-else` branches.
- **File:** [Link to Hiring Bot Repo](https://github.com/abhinavshrivastavgit/hiring_bot)
- **File:** [Link to Chip Margin Repo](https://github.com/abhinavshrivastavgit/chip_margin)
