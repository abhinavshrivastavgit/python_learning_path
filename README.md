# 🚀 Python Learning Lab: AI Product Management Edition

Welcome to my technical lab. As an aspiring **AI Product Manager**, I believe that understanding the "how" behind the code is just as important as the "why" behind the product. This repository tracks my evolution from basic syntax to building the logic engines that power AI-driven products.

## 🛠️ Portfolio Labs & File Guide

### 📊 Ranking & Data Comparison
**Goal:** Implement logic to rank product features or numerical outputs dynamically.
- **Key Concepts:** Sorting logic, indexing, and list manipulation.
- **Files:** `ranking_number.py` & `ranking_number.txt`

### 📦 Inventory Lifecycle Manager
**Goal:** Transition from single variables to managing collections of hardware (GPUs).
- **Key Concepts:** `list`, `.append()`, `.remove()`, and `len()`.
- **Logic:** Implemented a system to add/remove chips from the product stack to simulate inventory management.
- **File:** `inventory_manager.py`

### 🤖 Logic & Comparison Engines
**Goal:** Automating decision-making processes through code.
- **Largest Number:** Identifies the highest value within a dataset to assist in prioritizing product metrics.
- **Files:** `largest_number.py` & `largest_number.txt`

### 📝 Project Documentation & Exercises
- **README.md:** Project overview and AI PM profile.
- **exercise_III_part_2.py:** Coursera technical logic exercises.
- **exercise_summary.txt:** Documentation of remaining updates and logic flow.
