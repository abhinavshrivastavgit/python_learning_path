PROJECT: Largest Value Index Finder
VERSION: 1.0
AUTHOR: Abhinav Shrivastav
GOAL: Identify maximum performance metrics for AI PM Analysis
=====================================================

1. DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------
This script allows a user to input a series of numerical values 
(representing performance scores, GPU benchmarks, or model accuracy).
The program iterates through the data to find the highest value 
and records its exact position (index) within the dataset.

2. TECHNICAL LOGIC (THE "KING OF THE HILL" METHOD)
-----------------------------------------------------
The algorithm follows these specific steps:

A. INITIALIZATION:
   - Sets 'largest_num' to the first item in the list.
   - Sets 'trigger' (index tracker) to 0.
   - This ensures that if all numbers are negative, the script still works.

B. ITERATION (The While Loop):
   - The loop runs 'n' times (once for every item).
   - In each cycle, it compares the current_value to the largest_num.

C. CONDITIONAL TRIGGER:
   - IF (current_value > largest_num):
     * Update largest_num to the new value.
     * Update 'trigger' to the current 'count'.
   - ELSE:
     * Keep the old values.

D. INCREMENT:
   - The 'count' increases by 1 to move to the next "shelf" in the list.

3. DATA OUTPUT EXAMPLE
-----------------------------------------------------
Input: [21, 23, 34, 54, 72]
Processing:
- Check 21: Largest is 21, Trigger is 0
- Check 23: 23 > 21? Yes. Largest is 23, Trigger is 1
- Check 34: 34 > 23? Yes. Largest is 34, Trigger is 2
- Check 54: 54 > 34? Yes. Largest is 54, Trigger is 3
- Check 72: 72 > 54? Yes. Largest is 72, Trigger is 4

Final Result: Index num[4] holds the value 72.

4. PM INSIGHTS & FUTURE ROADMAP
-----------------------------------------------------
- ROBUSTNESS: The script uses int() conversion to ensure mathematical 
  accuracy during comparisons.
- OPTIMIZATION: The 'trigger' variable is only updated when a new record 
  is found, saving memory cycles.
- NEXT STEP: Implementation of "Runner-Up" logic to find the 
  second-highest performing model.
